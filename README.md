# Task: Creating a country management application in the NX monorepo environment with Angular, NgRx store and GraphQL (Apollo Client and Countries API)

## Sepcification:

### 1. **Monorepo with NX:**
- Create a monorepo using **NX**. Inside it, create an application called `country-management` in Angular.
- The application should be modular, with clearly defined modules (e.g. `countries`, `shared`).

### 2. **Frontend Angular Application:**
- The application UI should allow the user to see a list of countries, search countries by `name`, filter by `code`, `continent`, `currency` and see details about each country (e.g. `name`, `code`, `continent`, `currency`).

### 3. **State Management with NgRx:**
- Implement **NgRx store** to manage application state.
- Use `Actions`, `Reducers`, `Selectors` and `Effects` for operations such as loading a list of countries from the server, searching, filtering and displaying individual country details.

### 4. **GraphQL with Apollo Client and Countries API:**
- Connect the application to the **Countries API** using the **Apollo Client**.
- API endpoint: `https://countries.trevorblades.com/`
- Implement the following functionality using GraphQL:
- **List of countries**: Retrieve the list of countries from the server.
- **Filter countries, **: Allow the user to filter countries by `name`, `code`, `continent` and `currency`.
- **Country Details**: When the user clicks on a specific country, display its details, including `name`, `code`, `continent`, `currency` and `languages`.

## Technical requirements:
- Use lazy loading for modules where possible.
- **TypeScript** standards must be respected.
- Code must be neatly organized and follow Angular best practices.
- Use **Nx workspace** and take care of application performance.

## Additional information:
- **GraphQL Countries API Documentation**: The API is introspective, you can use GraphQL
- A playground for exploring the schema and available data.
- For the **Apollo Client**, use the `apollo-angular` library for easy integration with Angular application.

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve country-management
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build country-management
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project country-management
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
